 * ComparisonFailure} but it is not available in a particular test environment. In practice, that
 * should mean open-source JRE users who choose to exclude our JUnit 4 dependency.
 *
 * <p>(This class also includes logic to format expected and actual values for easier reading.)
 *
 * <p>Another part of the fallback logic is {@code Platform.ComparisonFailureWithFacts}, which has a
 * different implementation under GWT/j2cl, where {@code ComparisonFailure} is also unavailable but
 * we can't just recover from that at runtime.
